# Intuition
Looking at constraints is very important when problem solving. Note that val <= 2e5 and n <= 1e5. This tells us that the values that we will be dealing with will be at most 18 bits. I'm preferring them as bits because the problem want us to find the max xor between the val and all nodes within the path. \
Since the graph being depicted here is a tree, we know that there will be exactly 1 path going from node to the root.
