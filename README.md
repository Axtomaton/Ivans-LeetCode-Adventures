# Introduction
Hi! My name is Jie Chen and I'm currently studying @ RIT. \
I'm a DSA enthusiast and an ongoing competitive programmer. \
Currently on RIT ICPC Team. Attended 2023 - 2024 ICPC NENA Regional and received 11th place (Bronze Medal) \
I have 3 Leetcode accounts:
- [JustJie](https://leetcode.com/JustJie/) (Main Account)
- [SleepyJie](https://leetcode.com/SleepyJie/) (Smurf 1)
- [TiredJie](https://leetcode.com/TiredJie/) (Smurf 2)

I personally have 3 accounts because I really like to do leetcode contests and at times I would be very tired/sleepy or just not feeling it, that's when I will hop on those 2 smurf accounts. Here are some stats:\
Problem Solved: <547><665><211><1423> \
Contest Rating: 2498 (Peak: 2565)

# Overview
I will be splitting this repository into 2 parts:
- Problem
- Contest

## Problem
For problem section, I will sort them based on their leetcode difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard. For each problem, I will write out the code as well as the explanation for the problem. Each explanation will be in the following format:
1. Code
2. Explanation
3. Time Complexity
4. Reasoning for Time Complexity

However, there might be times when the explanation is incomplete. That would only happen if I can't think of the best way to explain the current question.

## Contest
For contest section, it's just going to be a storage area for my contest code and will not have explanation because it might or might not be well written.
